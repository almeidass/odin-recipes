    <h4>This bruschetta chicken recipe is perfect for springtime entertaining. Grilled chicken is topped with a fresh
        tomato-basil salad for a main dish thatâ€™s both beautiful and delicious.</h4>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry ranch or Italian salad dressing mix</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Directions</p>
    <ol>
        <li>On a clean work surface, halve each chicken breast horizontally (parallel to work surface) to make 8
            (4-ounce) cutlets. For marinade, combine olive oil and dressing mix in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag.
            Add chicken; seal bag and turn to coat completely. Chill at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for tomato salad, combine tomatoes, shallot, lemon juice, vinegar, basil, garlic, capers, salt,
            and pepper in a large bowl. Let stand at room temperature up to 1 hour before serving. </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat (350 to 375 degrees F (175 to 190 degrees C)). Remove chicken from
            marinade; discard marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Oil grill grates. Arrange chicken on grill. Cook, covered, turning halfway through, until an instant-read
            thermometer inserted into thickest parts of chicken registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 8 to 10 minutes.
            Serve chicken topped with tomato salad. Serve with Parmesan and lemon wedges.
