    <h4>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a
        must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.</h4>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Directions</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake
            off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until
            browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is
            cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</li>
    </ol>
